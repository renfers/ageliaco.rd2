Introduction
============



This product helps managing a service in the post-obligatory schools of Geneva.
"Ressource & Developpement" is a service that manages resources (hours of teaching used
to produce a pedagogic project) to help teachers bring new teaching resources.

This is an experimental project, to see how far I can push this dexterity/Plone matter ;-)
