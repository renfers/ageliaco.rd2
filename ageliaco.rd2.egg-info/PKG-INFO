Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        
        
        This product helps managing a service in the post-obligatory schools of Geneva.
        "Ressource & Developpement" is a service that manages resources (hours of teaching used
        to produce a pedagogic project) to help teachers bring new teaching resources.
        
        This is an experimental project, to see how far I can push this dexterity/Plone matter ;-)
